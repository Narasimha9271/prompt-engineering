### Basic Prompting

-   All you need to instruct model to perform a task is a prompt. A prompt is a piece of text that you give to the model to perform a task.
-   For example, if you want to summarize an article, you could simply write the prompt with the article text on the top and the prompt:

```
Long article text here .............
....................................

Summarize the above article for me.
```

-   Or if you want to generate a new text, you could simply write the prompt with the instructions and the model will give you the text.

```Write me an introductory guide about Prompt Engineering.

```

### Need for Prompt Engineering

-   Prompts play a key role in the process of generating useful and accurate information from AI language models.

-   learning how to write better prompts is important.
-   Without prompts, the model would generate content aimlessly, without any context or purpose. A well-crafted prompt helps guide the model’s behavior to produce useful and relevant results.
-   Prompts can help reduce inaccuracies and ambiguities in the AI’s responses. By providing a clear, concise, and complete prompt to the AI, users prevent the model from making unfounded assumptions or providing unclear information.
