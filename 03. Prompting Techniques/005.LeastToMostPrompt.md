## Least to Most Prompting

Least to Most prompting takes Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting a step further by first breaking a problem into sub problems then solving each one. It is a technique inspired by real-world educational strategies for children.

As in CoT prompting, the problem to be solved is decomposed in a set of subproblems that build upon each other. In a second step, these subproblems are solved one by one. Contrary to chain of thought, the solution of previous subproblems is fed into the prompt trying to solve the next problem.
The "least to most prompting" technique is a strategy often used in teaching and behavior interventions, particularly within the field of special education. The technique involves starting with the least amount of assistance necessary for a student to successfully complete a task and then gradually increasing the level of support or prompting until the desired response is achieved.
