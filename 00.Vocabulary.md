-   **Machine Learning (ML)** — ML is a field of study that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. ML is a subfield of AI.
-   **Model” vs. “AI” vs. “LLM** -
    AI ~== Model
    LLM is a type of AI, All LLM are AI but not viceversa.
-   **LLM — Large language model**. A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence that can understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. These models have been trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a wide range of language-related tasks, such as answering questions, carrying out conversations, summarizing text, translating languages, and much more.
-   **MLM** — Masked language model. A masked language model is a type of language model that is trained to predict the next word in a sequence of words. It is typically trained on a large corpus of text data and can be used for a variety of tasks, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, summarization, and more.
-   **NLP** — Natural language processing. Natural language processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. It is used to analyze, understand, and generate human language.
-   **Deep Learning (DL)** — DL is a subfield of ML that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.
-   **Neural Network (NN)** — NN is a type of ML algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain. NNs are the building blocks of DL.
-   **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** — ANN is a type of NN that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain. ANNs are the building blocks of DL.
-   **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** — CNN is a type of ANN that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain. CNNs are the building blocks of DL.
-   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** — RNN is a type of ANN that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain. RNNs are the building blocks of DL.
    **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** — RLHF is a technique for training a model to perform a task by providing it with human feedback. The model is trained to maximize the amount of positive feedback it receives from humans, while minimizing the amount of negative feedback it receives.

-   **Fine-tuning** is a process in which a pre-trained machine learning model is further trained on a specific dataset to adapt it to a particular task or domain.
