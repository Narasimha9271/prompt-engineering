# Real World Usage Examples

LLMs are used in a variety of ways. Here are some examples of how LLMs are used in the real world.

-   Natural Language Processing
-   Information Retrieval
-   Question Answering
-   Text Generation
-   Text Summarization
-   Learning Tools
-   Chatbots

### Structured Data

Asking the model to generate structured data is a great way to utilize the power of LLMs.

For example, you might have an e-commerce application where you want to generate the search query from the user’s natural language input. You can instruct LLM to identify the JSON version from the natural language text given by the user. Let’s say that the user searches for Birthday gift for my 18 months old daughter. We could have the following prompt to generate the JSON object:

```
Print a JSON object containing `gender` ("male", "female"), `occasion` (one of "party", "birthday", "anniversary"), `age_years` (numeric value) from the text delimited by tripple quotes.:
"""Birthday gift for my 18 months old daughter"""
```

The output from model would be:

```
{
  "gender": "female",
  "occasion": "birthday",
  "age_years": 1.5
}
```

### Inferring

Making use of LLMs to infer information from text is another common use case. Imagine you are running a famous e-commerce store with thousands of reviews. You want to group the reviews by the sentiment of the review. You can use LLMs to infer the sentiment of the review.

Here are some prompts showing the use of inferrence:

What is the sentiment of this text which is delimited with tripple backticks. Your output must be a single word.

```
"""Horrible product. They charged me twice the price and it broke after a week. I will never buy from them again."""
```

The output from this prompt is **negative**.

Another example:

Identify a list of emotions that the writer of the following review is expressing. Include no more than 5 items in the list. Format your answers as a list of lower-case words separated by commas.

```
"""I am so happy with this product. It is the best thing I have ever bought. I will definitely buy from them again."""
```

Output: **happy, satisfied, pleased, content, enthusiastic**

### Writing Emails

-   Language Models, like ChatGPT, can be incredibly beneficial for writing emails due to their ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.
-   When composing an email, an LLM can provide assistance with various aspects, such as generating engaging introductions or addressing specific questions or concerns.
-   For instance, if you’re writing a sales email, you can prompt the LLM with the request to generate a compelling opening paragraph that captures the recipient’s attention. Similarly, when responding to customer inquiries, you can ask the LLM to help craft clear and informative responses that address the query with precision.

For example, here is a prompt to generate an automated email response to a customer inquiry:

```Write an email informing a customer that their inquiry has been received and will be addressed shortly. Include the order number and the customer's name in the email.

```

Here is the response generated by the LLM:

```
Subject: Confirmation - Inquiry Received - Order #123456

Dear [Customer's Name],

```

### Coding Assistance

You can use ChatGPT for debugging, code generation, reformatting, commenting, and more.
Code Generation

Instructing ChatGPT to generate code is as simple as this:

```
Act as a junior python programmer. Please write the code to generate madlibs from 3 arrays of 6 items each: prepositions, verbs and nouns, with the nouns also being used as direct objects. After writing it, execute the code.
```

Output:

```
Explain
import random

prepositions = ['at', 'in', 'on', 'with', 'under', 'over']
verbs = ['run', 'jump', 'dance', 'sing', 'laugh', 'cry']
nouns = ['cat', 'dog', 'tree', 'flower', 'book', 'computer']

preposition = random.choice(prepositions)
verb = random.choice(verbs)
noun = random.choice(nouns)

madlib = f"I {verb} {preposition} the {noun}."

print(madlib)
```

#### Debugging

Ask like

```
Please debug this Python code:
..code
```

#### Commenting and Reformatting Code

Ask like

```
Please add line comments to this Python code and reformat it for legibility:
..code
```

#### Optimizing Code

If your script is taking too long to execute, ChatGPT can optimize it. Here’s an example of optimizing an inefficient script that finds prime numbers:

```
Act like a very senior python developer. Please optimize this script:
```

#### Translating Between Programming Languages

```
Act like an experienced developer with knowledge of both COBOL and Python. Please convert this COBOL program to Python:
...code
```

# Study Buddy

One of our favorite ways to use LLMs is as a study tool! In particular, it is useful for explaining confusing terms as well as quizzing you on test content.

#### Quizzing Yourself

**Generate 5 calculus I quiz questions for me:**
And the model will generate 5 questions for you to answer.

```1. What is the derivative of y = x3?
2. Evaluate the indefinite integral of x3 + 5x2 + 7x + 4.
3. What is the product rule for derivatives?
4. Find the equation of the line tangent to y = x2 at the point (4, 16).
5. What is the second derivative of y = x4?
```

-   There are probably other ways to use LLMs to study. Many learning companies like Duolingo and Quizlet are implementing LLMs into their products.

# Designing Chatbots

Building chatbots to offer customer support, sales, or other services is a hot topic in the tech industry. LLMs make it possible to build chatbots that can respond to a wide variety of user inputs, and can be trained to respond to new inputs with minimal effort.
